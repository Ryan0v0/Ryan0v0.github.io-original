Greetings! I am Wanru Zhao(赵婉如), a senior undergraduate student at Beihang University(Beijing, China), majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 	

Currently, I’m focusing on the topic of Graph Neural Network interpretability based on visualization for enormous graph data in [DGL Group](https://www.dgl.ai/) of Amazon AI Lab. Before that, I was working on the topic of crowdsourcing and big spatio-temporal data in dynamic pricing advised by [Prof. Yongxin Tong ](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~yxtong/). Besides, I also did a 6-month internship on compression and quantization of neural networks in Link and Compile Group(LCG)  in SenseTime, Beijing.
