* Took risky patterns as the keystones in danger management, and built causality networks among them for pain points identification, attribution and prediction.
* Used Spark and Hadoop to analyze the large-scale daily data in Beijing. 
* Built a 3D Geographic Information System(GIS) Visualization Platform using WebGL, D3.js and Leaflet.
