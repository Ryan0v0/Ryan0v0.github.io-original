  abstract={The recent advances in 3D Convolutional Neural Net-works (3D CNNs) have shown promising performance foruntrimmed video action detection, employing the popular de-tection framework that heavily relies on the temporal actionproposal generations as the input of the action detector and lo-calization regressor. In practice the proposals usually containstrong intra and inter relations among them, mainly stemmingfrom the temporal and spatial variations in the video actions.However, most of existing 3D CNNs ignore the relations andthus suffer from the redundant proposals degenerating thedetection performance and efficiency. To address this prob-lem, we propose graph attention based proposal 3D ConvNets(AGCN-P-3DCNNs) for video action detection. Specifically,our proposed graph attention is composed of intra attentionbased GCN and inter attention based GCN. We use intra at-tention to learn the intra long-range dependencies inside eachaction proposal and update node matrix of Intra Attentionbased GCN, and use inter attention to learn the inter depen-dencies between different action proposals as adjacency ma-trix of Inter Attention based GCN. Afterwards, we fuse intraand inter attention to model intra long-range dependenciesand inter dependencies simultaneously. Another contributionis that we propose a simple and effective framewise clas-sifier, which enhances the feature presentation capabilitiesof backbone model. Experiments on two proposal 3D Con-vNets based models (P-C3D and P-ResNet) and two popularaction detection benchmarks (THUMOS 2014, ActivityNetv1.3) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance achievedby our method. Particularly, P-C3D embedded with our mod-ule achieves average mAP 3.7\% improvement on THUMOS2014 dataset compared to original model.},
