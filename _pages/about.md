Greetings! I am Wanru Zhao(èµµå©‰å¦‚), a senior undergraduate student at Beihang University(Beijing, China), majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on the topic of self-supervised learning and visualization under the guidance of [Prof. Chaoli Wang](http://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). Before that, I was working on the topic of crowdsourcing and big spatio-temporal data in dynamic pricing advised by [Prof. Yongxin Tong ](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~yxtong/). Besides, I also did a 6-month internship on compression and quantization of neural networks in Link and Compile Group(LCG)  in SenseTime, Beijing.

ðŸŒŸIâ€™m actively looking for graduate research opportunities(Ph.D. or Msc) starting from Fall 2021.
